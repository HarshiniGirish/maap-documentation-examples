    "# Programmatic Access to NASA Data via Earthdata Login Tokens\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook details how to create and use EDL tokens to request data from NASA.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few ways to handle access from a user perspective.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Users could have their own EDL username and password, and use those credentials to generate tokens or use them directly in requests for data.\n",
    "2. The system stores a system username and password, such as username `esa_maap_user` along with an associated password. This username and password are stored in a secret store which only the algorithm development and async worker systems have access too. For example, the system that launches new Jupyter Lab instances, such as a Kubernetes cluster. These credentials are used to fetch or generate a token which is then set as an environment variable in Jupyter Lab or worker instances for making requests for data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are assuming option 2 is more desirable for the ESA MAAP system, so ESA MAAP users and workers don't have to create a new username and login with Earthdata Login in addition to their ESA MAAP login. Below is detailed an approach for generating fresh-enough tokens for users as the system launches their environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating new tokens\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a lifetime of an active Jupyter Lab system or worker of `active_session_time`, we want to ensure the token deployed to an active session will remain valid for the extent of the session. EDL tokens are valid for 90 days and there can be 2 active tokens, (see https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/documentation/for_users/user_token), when a system (development environment or worker) boots up:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If there are no active tokens, generate a token.\n",
    "2. If there are active tokens and one of those active tokens has an expiration that is greater than the current datetime + active session time, that token can be used since it won't expire in the lifetime of the active session.\n",
    "3. If there is only 1 active token but it will expire within the time of an active session, generate a new token. This token should be used by any new development environments or workers that boot up afterwards (until that token is also about to expire).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Considerations:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The below are taken from https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/users/aimeeb/user_tokens\n",
    "    * You can generate a bearer token for federated token access sharing. Not all EDL applications support Federated token access sharing.\n",
    "    * You may have up to 2 active tokens at a time.\n",
    "    * The token can then be passed into an application by using an Authorization: Bearer header\n",
    "    * The token will only authorize for applications that are EDL compliant and do not have unapproved EULAs\n",
    "* So, not all DAACs support token-based access - For example, this access was tested and working for GEDI02_A.002 but not SENTINEL-1A_SLC"
